Converting Between types
If you have a number but need to print it on the screen, you need to convert the value to a string
and in jS this conversion is called "coercion".

“var a = "42";
var b = Number( a );

console.log( a );    // "42"
console.log( b );    // 42”

“Using Number(..) (a built-in function) as shown is an explicit coercion from any 
other type to the number type. That should be pretty straightforward.”


Comments:
. Code without comments is suboptimal.
. Too many Comments is probably a sign of poorly written code.
